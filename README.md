#Time-varying Relationships Between Salmon Productivity and PDO and NPGO

##Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is identify to what extent the relationship between salmon productivity (recruits-per-spawner) and the **PDO** and **NPGO** indices has changed over time, and to what extent these changes are shared among regions.
